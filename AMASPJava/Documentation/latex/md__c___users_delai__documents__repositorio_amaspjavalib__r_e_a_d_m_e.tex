Amasp library for java.

This library implements the A\+M\+A\+SP (A\+S\+C\+II Master/\+Slave Protocol) for J\+Ava, a simple way to exchange messages between two computers using serial communication.

A\+M\+A\+SP is free and uses four different packets\+:

M\+A\+S\+T\+ER -\/$>$ S\+L\+A\+VE\+:

M\+RP -\/ Master Request Packet C\+EP -\/ Communication Error Packet

S\+L\+A\+VE -\/$>$ M\+A\+S\+T\+ER\+:

S\+RP -\/ Slave Response Packet S\+IP -\/ Slave Interruption Packet C\+EP -\/ Communication Error Packet

The protocol is transparent to the user that only needs to use the A\+M\+A\+SP Java Library functions to implement his own applications.

A\+M\+A\+S\+P\+Java\+Lib is under test and improvements, if you have any problem using it, please send a mail to the author (Spanish, Portuguese or English) \href{mailto:adelai@gmail.com}{\texttt{ adelai@gmail.\+com}}.

Contributors will be welcome!
